# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project is an analysis of successful and unsuccessful kickstarter campaigns globally.
### Module Analysis 
* For a basic summary, there are more successful kickstarter outcomes than are are canceled or failed combined.
![Total Count of Outcomes](https://github.com/natrockwood/kickstart-analysis/blob/master/Total%20Count%20of%20Outcomes.PNG)
* From these successful outcomes, most were started in May. This means that the spring/summer months are the best for starting kickstarter campaigns.

### Challenge
This further analysis was conducted to... 
* If the goals impacted the success or failure of the campaigns,
* If the launch dates of the campaigns determine the success or failures of the campaigns, and
* To determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.
#### Do the goals of a campaign in the "Plays" Subcategory influence its success or failure?
According to the chart below...
* The lower the goal, the more campaigns took place, and more were successful.
* The higher the goal, the lesser campaigns took placee, and more failed.
Overall, the higher the goal, the least likely the campaign was going to succeed in reaching its projected goals.

#### Does it matter when the "Theater" campaigns start?
According to the chart, there is a spike in the number of successful theater campaigns that start in May. 
* This may be because this is during the spring and summer, where people would (supposedly) be more outgoing. 
* There is a downward slope after that month as the summer months go by and the holidays start. 
* More campaigns start to fail starting in August, which is around when school starts, and continue to increase over the holidays. This is probably due to people travelling and being in school. 
* Not that many campaigns were cancelled throughout the year.

#### Does the length of a campaign determine its success or failure?
Overall, the average length of a campaign was 33 days. 73% of Successful campaigns happened under the average number of days. At the same time, 68% of failed campaigns also happened under the average number of days.
* With this analysis, the length of the campaigns don't really matter.
#### Conclusion
To conclude, the amount of the campaigns' goals for plays are inversely related to the number of campaigns that were taken place. More campaigns were more scucessful if the goals are lower. 
For theater campaigns, they are more successful when the campaigns start in the Summer months. According to the data, May is the best month to start theater campaigns.
Finally, the length of the campaigns don't matter as they last around a month, whether they succeed or fail.
